I am a third year PhD candidate in the [Decision, Risk, and Operations](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/divisions/decision-risk-operations) division of [Columbia Business School](https://home.gsb.columbia.edu/) where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hongseok Namkoong](https://hsnamkoong.github.io/).

My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of statistical inference, machine learning, and decision-making. In particular, I am interested in studying statistical inference problems that arise in unconventional settings and developing tools that allow for reliable estimation of causal effects. Recently, I have also worked on experimental design and non-parametric statistics.

Before joining Columbia, I graduated from the [University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu/) in 2019 where I studied mathematics and economics. I also spent two years as a research fellow at [Yale University](https://yale.edu/).
