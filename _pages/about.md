I am a Ph.D. student in the [Decision, Risk, and Operations](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/divisions/decision-risk-operations) division of [Columbia Business School](https://home.gsb.columbia.edu/) where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hongseok Namkoong](https://hsnamkoong.github.io/).

My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of theoretical statistics and decision-making. In particular, I am interested in studying statistical inference problems that arise in non-standard settings and developing tools that allow for reliable estimation of causal effects.

I graduated from the [University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu/) in 2019 where I studied mathematics and economics. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I also spent two years as a postgraduate research fellow at [Yale University](https://yale.edu/).
