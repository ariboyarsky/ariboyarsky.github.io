I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the [Decision, Risk, and Operations](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/divisions/decision-risk-operations) division of [Columbia Business School](https://home.gsb.columbia.edu/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of statistical inference and decision-making. I am particularly interested in developing robust nonparametric procedures for causal inference. I am especially concerned with the application of these methods to settings in which standard assumptions fail, such as in models of networks.

I received my M.A. from the [University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu/) where I studied economics and mathematics. Before starting at Columbia, I was an NBER Term Research Assistant and Postgraduate Visiting Fellow at [Yale University](https://yale.edu/)'s Economics Department. I am available via email at [a.boyarsky@columbia.edu](mailto:a.boyarsky@columbia.edu) and some projects may be found on my [Github page](http://github.com/ariboyarsky).
