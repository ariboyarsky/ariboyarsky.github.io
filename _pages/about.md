I am a Ph.D. student in the [Decision, Risk, and Operations](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/divisions/decision-risk-operations) division of [Columbia Business School](https://home.gsb.columbia.edu/). 

My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of statistical inference and decision-making. I am particularly interested in nonparametric inference in nonstandard settings and its application to problems of casual inference. More broadly, I am interested in questions related to statistical learning theory, empirical proccesses, and stochastic optimization. I am also working on more applied problems in offline decision-making and firm dynamics. 

Prior to coming to Columbia, I spent 2 years as a visiting postgraduate research fellow at [Yale University](https://yale.edu/). I previously recieved my M.A. in 2019 from the [University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu/) where I studied mathematics and economics.
