## Notes

The following is a selection of notes that I have put together on various topics in economics, mathematics, and statistics. These notes do not constitute original contributions rather they serve as a reference and to provide an avenue for me to explore new topics. All errors are my own.

Many of these documents are works in progress. The latest LaTeX/LyX code and PDF versions may be found in this <a href="https://github.com/ariboyarsky/Economics">Github repository</a>. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you find an error. If you would like to submit a correction or addition you may also find it useful to <a href="https://github.com/ariboyarsky/Economics/compare?expand=1">open a pull request</a>.
