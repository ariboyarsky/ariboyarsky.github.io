* A Sieve Approach to Nonparametric Estimation of Exchangeable Networks: Examples from International Trade.
     Ari Boyarsky
     <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
This paper considers the estimation and inference of nonparametric parameters of interest in a network model using the sieve extremum estimator. The main result is a central limit theorem for sieve extremum estimates that enables standard methods for inference of nonparametric parameters. The results rely on an assumption of exchangeability on the data generating process which in turn can be used to establish a conditional dependency graph to model the network interdependence. This varies from previous work on sieve extremum estimation that has only considered i.i.d. and weakly dependent data. The results in this paper justify the application of sieve estimation procedures to a wide range of network models. To illustrate this flexibility, I show how this method can be used to estimate infinite and finite-dimensional parameters in two models of international trade. I also show the equivalence of this setting to a generalization of psi-mixing developed for use in network models.</details>

* Adjusting Innovation: Firm-Level Responses to Trade Shocks.
     Ari Boyarsky and [Suleyman Gozen](https://www.suleymangozen.com/home)
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Many studies document various effects of trade shocks on firm and industry-level outcomes that generate winners and losers. However, there is a diverse set of evidence on which forces, in particular, lead to failure and success stories. This paper aims to contribute to this discussion by investigating the adjustments in firm-level innovation strategy in response to trade shocks. We plan to measure the firm adjustments in i) quality upgrading, ii) patenting activities, iii) process and product innovation, and iv) inventor composition. We aim to use large-scale patent data from the USPTO to investigate these adjustments using patent text-mining techniques. We decompose the total effect of trade shocks on the firm-level adjustments into four main underlying channels: 1) Direct effects at the exposed firms, 2) Indirect effects on other firms, which are captured through the network of patent citations, 3) Within and across industry reallocation effects, which are captured through inventor mobility, 4) Demand effects to capture the general equilibrium forces. This decomposition aims to answer the following questions: In high trade exposure industries, do we observe quality upgrading from productive firms that try to adapt to the changing business environment? Do we see large reallocation within and across industries with varying trade exposures? Can we quantify static loss (such as an increase in unemployment and decline in investment) but dynamic gain (such as quality upgrading and human capital reallocation) in industries with differential trade exposures? Thereby investigating how heterogeneity in firm-level responses to trade shocks may inform the trade policy decisions.</details>

* Robust Propensity Score Estimation and the Overlap Condition.
     Ari Boyarsky
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
A large body of research in the social and physical sciences is concerned with the estimation of causal effects in observational studies. These analyses often employ propensity score matching methods to recover these parameters. Unfortunately, this methodology relies on strong assumptions on the support of the propensity score that are not always satisfied. This paper attempts to provide a rigorous analysis and assessment of the propensity score overlap condition. To this end, I introduce the support vector machine (SVM) as a powerful statistical approach to estimate propensity scores and assess the overlap assumption. I use simulated data to show the comparative advantage of this methodology relative to previous methods especially in the case where there is a nonlinear determination of treatment. Finally, I illustrate how to apply this methodology using the commonly studied LaLonde (1986) experimental and non-experimental data sets.</details>
